## A Secure Sockets Layer \(SSLv2\) Client


</div>

### Description

This is an example SSL Client I created. I looked everywhere and could find no examples in Visual Basic, or C++ for that matter. I did find some commercially available controls but those were upwards of $1,000 for a license. I hope you find this code useful, thanks.
 
### More Info
 
128-bit High Encryption Pack is required. If you don't have it the program will tell you where to get it.
